# Procedural Map Generation

In computing, procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms  coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. In computer graphics, it is commonly used to create textures and 3D models. *In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Depending on the implementation, advantages of procedural generation can include smaller file sizes, larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay.* Procedural generation is a branch of media synthesis.
